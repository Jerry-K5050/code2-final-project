It is best if it is run and tested outside of p5.js. My suggestion is to use vscode or other code editors. I don't know why but in p5.js there is no background, even though it works perfectly fine on vscode and my web browser.

Backend development such as Java and databases (MySQL) needed to be implemented into this project afterwards.
This project is unfinished due to time limit
